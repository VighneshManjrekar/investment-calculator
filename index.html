                    Return on Investment or ROI shows you the return from your investments. It helps you to choose
                    the best
                    investment across different investment options. You may evaluate the investment based on your
                    financial
                    goals and risk tolerance. You could also gauge the cost of your investment and look for hidden
                    charges
                    that could eat up your returns. The return on investment is usually expressed as a percentage.
                    In simple
                    terms, the return on investment is a financial ratio that helps you determine the benefit of
                    your
                    investment against the costs. You may calculate the return on investment using the formula: ROI
                    = Net
                    Profit / Cost of the investment * 100 If you are an investor, the ROI shows you the
                    profitability of
                    your investments. If you invest your money in mutual funds, the return on investment shows you
                    the gain
                    from your mutual fund schemes. ROI may be positive or negative. If the return on investment is
                    negative,
                    you are actually losing money on the investment. You must pick an investment that may offer you
                    the
                    maximum return over a period.
